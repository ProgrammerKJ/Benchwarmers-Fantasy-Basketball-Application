# Currently Unnamed NBA Fantasy Website
## HTD Cohort 6 - Group 6 AKA Exception Handlers
### Nicolas Perez, Kevin Sanchez, Krishna Joshi, Asim Shariff


## Problem Statement
* Context: 
  * Fantasy sports has grown into a massive global industry with many fans creating virtual teams based on current NBA athletes. While many major league platforms exist, they often provide fantasy sports as a small section or portion of their site, we focus our entire site on fantasy, to provide users with a more personal fantasy experience.

* Core Problem: 
  * Existing NBA fantasy platforms typically offer fantasy leagues as just one small feature among many different features. This leaves users who want to focus solely on fantasy sports with a cluttered interface full of unneeded elements that cloud their experience and distract from their primary interest.

* Impact on Users: 
  * NBA fantasy enthusiasts are left with depthless experiences that donâ€™t fully satisfy their desire for a fully focused fantasy application, meaningful connections with other fantasy players, and real time stat and schedule tracking.

* Opportunity for Solution: 
  * By creating a dedicated application focused exclusively on NBA fantasy basketball, we can provide users with a richer, more personal experience that brings together comprehensive team building, detailed player and team statistics, and integrated social features. This specialized approach will allow fantasy enthusiasts to make better decisions regarding team creation, engage in a meaningful way with other fantasy players, and access an application whose sole focus is fantasy sports and nothing else.

## Technical Solution
* We will build a web application that is focused exclusively on NBA fantasy basketball that eliminates all the clutter found on other major fantasy platforms. Our application will provide users with a streamlined experience centered around creating and managing fantasy teams, accessing real-time player statistics, viewing game schedules, and interacting with other basketball fantasy enthusiasts. By focusing solely on fantasy basketball, we'll deliver a more personal and engaging platform that addresses the core needs of NBA fantasy players without other unnecessary distractions.

* Key Features:

  * User Registration and Profile Managment - Users can create accounts, customize profiles, and manage their fantasy participation setting. (All users, can create fantasy teams but only admins can create, modify and delete fantasy leagues).

  * Fantasy Team Creation and Management - Users can Create multiple fantasy teams, draft unique players within each fantasy team.

  * Player Statistics Dashboard - Users can view real time player statistics displayed through appealing visualization methods (possibly Chart.js), helping users make informaed decisions about players based on data.

  * Game Schedule - Users can see upcoming games and view team and player performances from recent games.

  * Social Interaction Features - There will be a chat feed for all users to communicate with each other and also a private leauge chat for users to communicate with other users in the leauges. (Stretch Goal)

  * Real-time Notifications - Injury reports and statistics for recent games will be updated in real time.

* User Scenarios:

  * Scenario 1: Krishna, a fantasy basketball fan, logs into the application to prepare for his upcoming fantasy season. After a successful authentication, he immediately checks the latest injury reports for key players he is considering for his team. He browses through player statistics, filtering by position and taking note of player performances. After analyzing several players' recent performances, he decides which players to target for his fantasy team. He creates a new league called the "Downtown Ballers", and invites his friends to join via the platform. As league creator, he automatically becomes the admin with privileges to manage league settings.

  * Scenario 2: Asim joins a fantasy league after his friend told him about a recently created league he created. After logging in, he navigates to the league dashboard and joins the team "Hoop City" and views which players are still up for selection. He strategically starts to build his team but notices that players selected by other team members are not available for selection anymore. Each day he checks his fantasy score, which updates automatically based on his players' performance from previous night's games. He really enjoys tracking his team's ranking within the league and the competitive aspect of seeing his calculated fantasy score compared to other teams.


* Technology Stack:

  * Frontend:

    * TypeScript for type-safe code development
    * React for building a responsive and interactive interface with reausable components
    * Chart.js for creating dynamic and visually appealing charts for player statistics.

  * Backend:

    * Java with SpringBoot for building a scalable REST API that can handle user authentication and data processing.
    * JWT for secure authentication and authorization

  * Database:

    * MySQL, a reliable relational database that can handle complex relationships between users, teams, players, and leauges.

  * External APIs:

    * SportRadar API for accessing comprehensive NBA team schedules and box scores
    * Swagger Sports API for accessing indivdual players and teams

* DevOps:

  * Docker for containerization, enuring consistent deployment across different enviorments.

## Glossary

* Player
  * A person who plays for their respective team. They can be drafted to teams, dropped from teams and edited positions based on their performance or if they're injured.

* User
  * User who can view and participate in fantasy leagues. Needs to create an account before they can access created leagues.

* Admins
  * Users who can create fantasy leagues and invite other users into their leagues.

* Fantasy League
  * Participants(Users and Admins) assemble virtual teams of real-life players, and their performance in actual games earns points for their fantasy teams, with the goal of accumulating the most points and winning against other teams in the league

 
## High Level Requirements
 * Manage 4-7 database tables (entities) that are independent concepts.
   * We will implement 6 tables to fit our needs and provide a place to put Users, Leagues, Teams, and Interactions.
 * MySQL for data management
   * We will be using a MySQL database contained within a Docker Container, to store the data we create, and access and modify it using JDBC
 * Spring Boot, MVC, JDBC, Testing
   * SpringBoot will be used to run our application and provide the environment to the application.
   * We will be organizing our code using the Model, View, Controller architecture to cleanly follow OOP Principals.
   * JDBC AS previously mentioned will be used to connect to our Database, and access and modify data.
   * We will be writing Unit Tests and performing Manual Integration tests.
 * An HTML and CSS UI that's built with React
   * We will be using React to create our frontend based on the created Wireframe, and will apply Accessibility principals to make sure our app can be enjoyed by everyone.
 * Sensible layering and pattern choices
   * We will make sure that our Data, Service and Controller layers will function independently of each other, and each only provides one role to the project, allowing for flexibility and modularity.
 * A full test suite that covers the domain and data layers
   * We will be testing both the Front and Back end of the project, both separately as Unit Tests and together as Manual Integration Tests.
   * We will in particular be writing unit tests for the data, and service layers to make sure the data we will be providing will be clean, validated, and accessible.
 * Must have at least 2 roles (example User and Admin)
   * User: Users will be able to join leagues, create teams, view teams/players 
   * Admin: Additionally, admins will be able to create and manage Leagues as well as User members of those Leagues.

## Learning Goal
* Learning Goal Item:
  * TypeScript
* Application:
  * We will use Typescript to exert static typing and stricter control on class member visibility over our app's programming.
* Research and Resources:
  * The official TypeScript Handbook will be invaluable to see the differences between base Javascript and Typescript
    * https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/intro.html
  *
* Challenges:
  * Falling back on JS variables and typing would be easy, so we will commit to only using TypeScript throughout the project.
* Success Criteria:
  * If we are able to complete the project's frontend without falling back onto basic Javascript type handling, we'll consider this goal achieved.
