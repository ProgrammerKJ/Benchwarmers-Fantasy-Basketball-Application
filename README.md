### Issues/Bugs

* [ ] find bugs that are preventing the project from running as expected and assign to developers and fix accordingly 

#### High Priority (must fix)


#### Medium Priority

- [ ] Save your changes, then add your changes using the command: `git add .`
- [ ] Commit your changes to the development branch `git commit -m 'initial commit'` 
- [ ] push your changes to the development branch `git push -u origin development`

## Rest of the Team to Clone the Repository

- [ ] provide the URL to each developer on your team (link in group chat)
- [ ] Each developer should clone the repository to their local machine using the following command in their terminal or Git client: `git clone <repository_url>` (Replace <repository_url> with the URL of the repository.)
- Once you have cloned the repository down switch to the development branch `git checkout development` and ensure you see your name and tasks inside of the readme file. 

## Collaborative Work Flow

- [ ] Each developer should work on their assigned tasks or features in separate branches. They can create a new branch for their work using the following command: `git checkout -b YourName` replace your name with your firstname-lastname
- [ ] After making changes to their code, they can stage and commit their changes using the following commands: `git add .` , `git commit -m "Descriptive commit message"` Please practice writing meaningful commit messages this week (we will be paying attention to this).
- [ ] To keep their local branch up to date with the latest changes from the development branch, they can switch back to the development branch using git checkout development and run the following commands: `git pull origin development` `git checkout <branch_name>` `git merge development` These commands pull the latest changes from the development branch, switch back to their branch, and merge the changes from the development branch into their branch.
- [ ] Once the code changes are ready to be shared with the team, they can push their branch to the remote repository using the following command: `git push origin YourName` your name being the name of the branch, your firstname-lastname

## Pull Request and Code Review

- [ ] After pushing their branch, each developer should go to the repository's page on GitHub. They will see a notification to create a pull request for the branch they just pushed.
- [ ] Click on the "Compare & pull request" button, add a descriptive title and comment if necessary, and then click on "Create pull request." Make sure that the main branch is `development` and that your compare branch is your named branch. 
- [ ] The other team members can review the code changes, provide feedback, and discuss the changes within the pull request - feel free to leave comments on the pull request and request changes. 

## Merge Changes into Development:

- [ ] Once the changes in the pull request have been reviewed and approved by all team members a designated person should merge the changes into the development branch. Communication is KEY here. if two people are working on the same file in different branches you WILL run into merge conflicts. Be very clear in your communication on who is working on what to avoid this. 

> Note: You may need to merge changes into developement more than once. Whenever a team member has a major feature working and ready to share with the rest of the team a pull request should be made, reviewed and merged (on approval) into development. The other team members will want to pull the merged changes down and into their own branches so that they also have a working version locally.

## Pull Changes to Local Environment:

- [ ] After the changes are merged into the development branch, each developer should switch back to the development branch in their local environment using `git checkout development`
- [ ] They can pull the latest changes to their local development branch using `git pull origin development`

We will do a final review on Thursday with project presentations before merging to main for final prestations on Friday Morning.
